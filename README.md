# Sintropy-x-Shelly-Design-Challenge
We want to integrate a **Shelly devices module** into the **Sintropy** platform using our APIs.  ⚠️ This challenge is focused on **reasoning**, not on code.   We will not compile or execute anything.   We are interested in understanding **how you think**, how you structure a problem, and how you explain your decisions.
